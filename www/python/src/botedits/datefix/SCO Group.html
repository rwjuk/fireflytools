In particular, in February 2005, Judge Dale Kimball, the judge in the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' case has stated:&lt;ref&gt;''The SCO Group, Inc. vs. International Business Machines, Inc.'' case number 2:03cv0294 [[United States District Court for the District of Utah]] doc #398 [http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-398.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;</td></tr>
