Furthermore, reading dynamic memory is a destructive operation, requiring a recharge of the storage cells in the row that has been read. If these processes are imperfect, a read operation can cause [[soft error]]s. In particular, there is a risk that some charge can leak between nearby cells, causing the refresh or read of one row to cause a ''disturbance error'' in an adjacent or even nearby row. The awareness of disturbance errors dates back to the first commercially available DRAM in the early 1970s (the [[Intel 1103]]). Despite the mitigation techniques employed by manufacturers, commercial researchers proved in a 2014 analysis that commercially available [[DDR3]] DRAM chips manufactured in 2012 and 2013 are susceptible to disturbance errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/dram-row-hammer_kim_talk_isca14.pdf | title = Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them: DRAM Disturbance Errors | date = <span class="diff_chg">{{date|</span>2014-0<span class="diff_chg">6-24|mdy}} | access-date = {{date|</span>2015-<span class="diff_chg">03</span>-<span class="diff_chg">10|mdy}} | author1 = Yoongu Kim | author2 = Ross Daly | author3 = Jeremie Kim | author4 = Chris Fallin | author5 = Ji Hye Lee | author6 = Donghyuk Lee | author7 = Chris Wilkerson | author8 = Konrad Lai | author9 = Onur Mutlu | website = ece.cmu.edu | url-status = live | archive-url =</span> https://web.archive.org/web/20150326080426/http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/dram-row-hammer_kim_talk_isca14.pdf | archive-date = 2015-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The associated side effect that led to observed bit flips has been dubbed ''[[row hammer]]''.</td><td class="diff_next"><a href="#difflib_chg_to225__top">t</a></td><td class="diff_header" id="to225_286">286</td><td >Dynamic memory, by definition, requires periodic refresh.
