He is met outside the subterranean complex by Dr. Doug Phillips, who ushers him in. They are met by Lt. General Heywood Kirk, known to Clark as his former commanding officer when he was a [[paratrooper]] in the army. As chairman of the Senate committee overseeing the Time Tunnel, Clark lets it be known that he can either authorize the continued funding of the project or "cut [its] [[umbilical cord]]", He wants immediate results. Dr. Tony Newman wants to comply by "going into time", but Phillips, the project chief, vetoes the offer. Late that night while the others are elsewhere, Tony powers up the Time Tunnel, enters, and successfully sends himself back in time. He arrives on board the ''Titanic'' on Saturday, April 13, the day before it [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|collides with an iceberg and sinks]]. He meets Ms. Althea Hall, played by [[Susan Hampshire]], when he "lands" on one of the ship's promenade decks. Later when he learns that he is aboard the Titanic, he runs into the captain, played by [[Michael Rennie]], whom he tries to urge to sail further south to avoid [[iceberg]]s. As he does this, he discloses the incredible facts explaining his own presence on board. The unconvinced captain has Tony arrested as a [[stowaway]] and held incommunicado, although he is seen and heard by those in the Time Tunnel control room, who are tracking him. Doug Phillips decides to follow Tony into time to rescue him and try to convince the captain of the imminent disaster with a newspaper reporting the matter the day after. General Kirk permits him to go. Doug finds himself in the boiler room of the ship, makes his way further into the ship, and enlists the aid of a French lad, Marcel Copot, played by Gerard Michenaud, to help get Tony free. After breaking Tony out of the cabin, they go to the wireless room to send an [[SOS]] message. They overcome the staff armed with Tony's guard's pistol, but they are overpowered by the captain and his detail and locked back into the cabin Tony had occupied. As Tony and Doug had predicted, the ship strikes an iceberg at 11:40&amp;nbsp;pm, bringing the captain to Tony and Doug, who then are successful in getting him to order the "abandon ship" procedure. Doug gets to place his friend Marcel with his mother onto a lifeboat, and Tony persuades a reluctant Althea Hall to board one. Thrown off the ship by an explosion, Tony and Doug are successfully frozen in time by the Time Tunnel control room, and placed in "time limbo". Since Tony and Doug are still lost in time, Senator Clark assures Time Tunnel control that he will not discontinue funding.</td><td class="diff_next"></td><td class="diff_header" id="to810_82">82</td><td >| ShortSummary=United States Senator Leroy Clark ([[Gary Merrill]]) arrives from Washington, DC, to investigate the progress of Project Tic-Toc in Arizona.

(See the [[Baltimore Plot]]). The ringleader is Jeremiah Gebhardt, played by [[Scott Marlowe]], who was an accomplice of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in his 1859 [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid on Harpers Ferry]]. Tony and Doug are met by Matthew Gebhardt, played by [[Tom Skerritt]]. In the Time Tunnel control room, the image screen shifts its image to the April 14, 1865, [[assassination of Lincoln]] in Ford's Theater, confusing the general, Ann, and Ray, but associating the events, the attempted assassination with the successful assassination. Jeremiah points out that the southern [[secession]]ists would be blamed, thereby sparking a war with the [[Southern United States|South]] and resulting in an end to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The meeting is violently broken up by Lincoln's security detail led by [[Allan Pinkerton]], played by [[R.G. Armstrong]], who kill four of the conspirators and take Doug into custody. Tony escapes with Jeremiah and Matthew to their home, where they live with their 11-year-old brother David, played by Christopher Harris. Jeremiah reveals the particulars of his plot to Tony: he has constructed a [[time bomb]] that he plans to plant on Lincoln's train when it is switched to "the Washington line." Jeremiah hears Lincoln's train as it arrives at the abandoned depot, and goes to investigate. Tony tries to dissuade Matthew from the plot, which he knows from history will fail. Doug is interrogated by Pinkerton as Lincoln's train arrives, and Lincoln is invited into the depot where Doug gets the opportunity to talk with him. In response to Lincoln's concern about the survival of the Union, Doug assures him that it will survive for more than a century to come. Since Pinkerton had delayed Lincoln's train due to the actual assassination plot he partially foiled, Jeremiah changes his plan to bombing the depot. Tony resists, and is tied up in the kitchen. Matthew diverts Pinkerton's attention from the depot by shooting a rabbit near the depot, allowing Jeremiah to place the time bomb next to the depot. Tony manages to escape from the Gebhardt house, get to the depot, and intercept the bomb, which he throws away from the depot. David finds the bomb, examines it, and is picked up by the Time Tunnel when General Kirk decides to bring the bomb into the tunnel to defuse it. Afraid to come out of the tunnel, David is thrown a pack of tools to help him stop the bomb's timing dial. He succeeds by placing a screw driver into the hole for the windup key. David is then returned to 1861. Matthew decides to stop Jeremiah, but Jeremiah finds the bomb and attempts to follow through with his plan until Matthew stands up to him. Brotherly affection gets the better of Jeremiah, and he goes home with Matthew after Doug throws the bomb safely away. Tony and he notice the screwdriver that David had placed into the bomb, which they realize could only have come from the Time Tunnel. They dematerialize to their next adventure.</td><td class="diff_next"></td><td class="diff_header" id="to810_224">224</td><td >| ShortSummary=A barn in an abandoned northern neighborhood of [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] is the landing place of Tony and Doug where they become involved in an [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] plot to assassinate [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] on his way secretly to Washington, DC, for his inauguration on March 4, 1861.

In the Time Tunnel control room, the image screen shifts its image to the April 14, 1865, [[assassination of Lincoln]] in Ford's Theater, confusing the general, Ann, and Ray, but associating the events, the attempted assassination with the successful assassination. Jeremiah points out that the southern [[secession]]ists would be blamed, thereby sparking a war with the [[Southern United States|South]] and resulting in an end to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The meeting is violently broken up by Lincoln's security detail led by [[Allan Pinkerton]], played by [[R.G. Armstrong]], who kill four of the conspirators and take Doug into custody. Tony escapes with Jeremiah and Matthew to their home, where they live with their 11-year-old brother David, played by Christopher Harris. Jeremiah reveals the particulars of his plot to Tony: he has constructed a [[time bomb]] that he plans to plant on Lincoln's train when it is switched to "the Washington line." Jeremiah hears Lincoln's train as it arrives at the abandoned depot, and goes to investigate. Tony tries to dissuade Matthew from the plot, which he knows from history will fail. Doug is interrogated by Pinkerton as Lincoln's train arrives, and Lincoln is invited into the depot where Doug gets the opportunity to talk with him. In response to Lincoln's concern about the survival of the Union, Doug assures him that it will survive for more than a century to come. Since Pinkerton had delayed Lincoln's train due to the actual assassination plot he partially foiled, Jeremiah changes his plan to bombing the depot. Tony resists, and is tied up in the kitchen. Matthew diverts Pinkerton's attention from the depot by shooting a rabbit near the depot, allowing Jeremiah to place the time bomb next to the depot. Tony manages to escape from the Gebhardt house, get to the depot, and intercept the bomb, which he throws away from the depot. David finds the bomb, examines it, and is picked up by the Time Tunnel when General Kirk decides to bring the bomb into the tunnel to defuse it. Afraid to come out of the tunnel, David is thrown a pack of tools to help him stop the bomb's timing dial. He succeeds by placing a screw driver into the hole for the windup key. David is then returned to 1861. Matthew decides to stop Jeremiah, but Jeremiah finds the bomb and attempts to follow through with his plan until Matthew stands up to him. Brotherly affection gets the better of Jeremiah, and he goes home with Matthew after Doug throws the bomb safely away. Tony and he notice the screwdriver that David had placed into the bomb, which they realize could only have come from the Time Tunnel. They dematerialize to their next adventure.</td></tr>
