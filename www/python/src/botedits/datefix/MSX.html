The new MSX system is housed in a box made out of transparent blue plastic, and can be used with a standard monitor (or TV) and a PC keyboard. It has two MSX cartridge slots and supports the audio extensions [[Yamaha YM2413|MSX-MUSIC]] and SCC+. A [[memory card|SD/MMC-flashcard]] can be used as an external storage medium, emulating a [[Disk storage|disk drive]] and can be used to boot [[MSX-DOS]]. Due to its [[VHDL]] programmable hardware, it is possible to give the device new hardware extensions simply by running a reconfiguration program under MSX-DOS. The "one chip-MSX" also has two [[USB]] connectors that can be used after adding some supporting VHDL code.</td><td class="diff_next"></td><td class="diff_header" id="to341_122">122</td><td >In 2001, Kazuhiko Nishi initiated a 'MSX Revival' around an official MSX [[emulator]] called MSXPLAYer.
