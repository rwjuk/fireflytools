Early mouthpieces were designed to produce a "warm" and "round" sound for classical playing. Among classical mouthpieces, those with a concave ("excavated") ''chamber'' are more true to Adolphe Sax's original design; these provide a softer or less piercing tone favored by the [[Sigurd Raschèr|Raschèr]] school of classical playing. Saxophonists who follow the French school of classical playing, influenced by [[Marcel Mule]], generally use mouthpieces with smaller chambers for a somewhat "brighter" sound with relatively more upper harmonics.  The use of the saxophone in dance orchestras and jazz ensembles from the 1920s onward placed emphasis on [[dynamic range]] and projection, leading to innovation in mouthpiece designs. At the opposite extreme from the classical mouthpieces are those with a small chamber and a low clearance above the reed between the tip and the chamber, called high ''baffle''. These produce a bright sound with maximum projection, suitable for having a sound stand out among amplified instruments.</td><td class="diff_next"><a href="#difflib_chg_to96__top">t</a></td><td class="diff_header" id="to96_102">102</td><td >Mouthpiece design has a profound impact on tone.&lt;ref name="erousseau"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eugene-rousseau.com/discussions.htm#Art | at=The Art of Choosing a Saxophone Mouthpiece | last=Rousseau | first=Eugene | author-link=Eugene Rousseau (saxophonist) | title=Discussions | website=EugeneRousseau.com | access-date=<span class="diff_chg">27 April </span>2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405192044/http://www.eugene-rousseau.com/discussions.htm#Art | archive-date=2016-04-05 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different mouthpiece design characteristics and features tend to be favored for different styles.
