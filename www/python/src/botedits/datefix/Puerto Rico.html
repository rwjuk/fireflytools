Patricia Gherovici states that both ''Porto Rico'' and ''Puerto Rico'' were used interchangeably in the news media and documentation before, during, and after the U.S. conquest of the island in 1898. The ''Porto'' spelling, for instance, was used in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], but ''Puerto'' was used by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that same year. Nancy Morris clarifies that "a curious oversight in the drafting of the [[Foraker Act]] caused the name of the island to be officially misspelled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patricia Gherovici |title=The Puerto Rican syndrome |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jSsxVWxu2sC |year=2003 |publisher=Other Press, LLC |isbn=978-1-892746-75-7 |pages=[https://books.google.com/?id=2jSsxVWxu2sC&amp;pg=PA140 140–141]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gervasio Luis Garcia traces the Anglicized spelling to a ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' article from 1899, after which the spelling was kept by many agencies and entities because of the ethnic and linguistic pride of the English-speaking citizens of the American mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dw2ZjkgjchkC |title=Hispanic Americans in Congress, 1822–2012 |last=Historian |first=Office of the |date=1 January 2013 |publisher=Government Printing Office |isbn=9780160920684 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/registerportori03ricogoog |title=Register of Porto Rico |last1=Secretary's |first1=Puerto Rico |last2=Office |first2=Puerto Rico Secretary's |date=1 January 1903 |publisher=Office of the Secretary |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWczAQAAIAAJ |title=Porto Rico: A Caribbean Isle |last1=Deusen |first1=Richard James Van |last2=Deusen |first2=Elizabeth Kneipple Van |date=1931 |publisher=Henry Holt |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGhNAAAAYAAJ |title=Scientific survey of Porto Rico and the Virgin Islands |last=Sciences |first=New York Academy of |date=1922 |publisher=New York Academy of Sciences |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;</td></tr>
