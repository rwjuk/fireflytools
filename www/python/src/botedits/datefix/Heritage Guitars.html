The marketing was handled by the former VP of sales from Gibson, Lane Zastrow. The advertisements made it clear that Heritage was making guitars on Parsons Street in Kalamazoo, without ever mentioning Gibson by name, and the company began to develop an image as the alternative to Gibson at a time when Gibson was going through a period of transition and rebuilding.  In the 1990s, in an attempt to keep costs down, the company all but stopped advertising.
